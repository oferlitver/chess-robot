# chess-robot
Final project in my Bachelor's robotics lab

In this project I created a system to combine the capabilites of a robotic arm with that of the (Stockfish)[https://stockfishchess.org/] chess engine, a powerful and open-source chess engine. The GUI interface is (arena)[http://www.playwitharena.com/].
